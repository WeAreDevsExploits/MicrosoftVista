at least this is the simulator app of windows vista.
how to get it: www.Github.com and Search Windows Vista Simuator App
and press WindowsSimulator (Folder to download and unzip it.)
once now you're done and
go to WindowsSimulator > exeProccess > WindowsProcess.exe and open it, it is a exe file (i changed it as bat file xd)
